Exploring layers
================

This section gives you a minimal description of how to use the Yocto Project to build images for Beaglebone hardware starting from scratch. 

The Beaglebone Black is a low-cost ARM Cortex-A8-based development board. 

The Yocto Project officially supports the Beaglebone board and provides a minimal bootable BSP support. 



What is the BSP Layer?
-------------------

A Board Support Package (BSP) is a collection of information that defines how to support a particular hardware device, set of devices, or hardware platform. 

The BSP includes information about the hardware features present on the device and kernel configuration information along with any additional hardware drivers required. 

The BSP also lists any additional software components required in addition to a generic Linux software stack for both essential and optional platform features.

Naming Convention: meta-<bsp_name>

The string “meta-” is prepended to the machine or platform name.



How to find out which hardware devices are supported
----------------------------------------------------

'conf/machine/*.conf' list all the hardware devices supported by the BSP layer.



meta-yocto-bsp
--------------

	- Provides "reference" BSPs for each of the supported architectures
	- It is based on the mainline kernel/bootloader
	- Does not support any advanced features or anything not in the upstream mainline kernel
	- e.g. no capes, no power management, no hardware acceleration, no 3D, no PRU, etc.
	- The purpose of this BSP is to have some basic out-of-box experience for the select hardware platforms within Poky to evaluate the Yocto Project and OpenEmbedded framework, but not the specific hardware platforms



meta-ti
----------

The official OpenEmbedded/Yocto BSP layer for Texas Instruments platforms.

Most of the advanced features and peripheral support for the wider range of latest TI platforms.

$ git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-ti



Adding Layers
--------------

Two ways:

1. Manual: 
	- Edit bblayers.conf file and add the new layer to BBLAYERS

2. Automatic: 
	- $ bitbake-layers add-layer <path-to-new-layer>



Steps for building
-------------------

Step1: 
	
	- Source the environment script

		$ source poky/oe-init-build-env

	- Add the meta-ti layer

		$ bitbake-layers add-layer ../meta-ti/

Step2: 

	- Open local.conf and set Machine to beaglebone
	
		MACHINE='beaglebone'

Step3: 

	- You can also set BB_NUMBER_THREADS and PARALLEL_MAKE to twice your host processor's number of cores

		BB_NUMBER_THREADS = "8"
     	PARALLEL_MAKE = "-j 8"

	- Also, add this to ease your hard drive demands during builds

		INHERIT += "rm_work" 


Step4: 

	- Generate an minimal image

		$ bitbake -k core-image-minimal

Step5: 

	- Once the build finished, you will find the output images under "$BUILDDIR/tmp/deploy/images/beaglebone"  



Flashing the image on the sd card using wic
-------------------------------------------

wic images are SD Card images and can be directly written into a sd card.

The file 'core-image-minimal-beaglebone.wic.xz' is a compressed wic image.

You can use the bmap-tools:

	$ sudo bmaptool copy core-image-minimal-beaglebone.wic.bz2 /dev/sdb

Or do it yourself manually:

	- Uncompress the image using the 'unxz' utility:
	$ unxz core-image-minimal-beaglebone.wic.xz

	- Flash it to the sd card:
	$ sudo dd if=core-image-minimal-beaglebone.wic of=/dev/sdb bs=4096 status=progress && sync
