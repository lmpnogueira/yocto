Lab 1
=====

This lab steps you through the process for a typical image build using the Yocto Project.



Compatible Linux Distribution
-----------------------------

Make sure your Build Host meets the following requirements:

	- At least 90 Gbytes of free disk space, though much more will help to run multiple builds and increase performance by reusing build artifacts
	- At least 8 Gbytes of RAM, though a modern modern build host with as much RAM and as many CPU cores as possible is strongly recommended to maximize build performance
	- Runs a supported Linux distribution (i.e. recent releases of Fedora, openSUSE, CentOS, Debian, or Ubuntu).
	- For a list of Linux distributions that support the Yocto Project, see the Supported Linux Distributions section in the Yocto Project Reference Manual
	- The OpenEmbedded build system should be able to run on any modern distribution that has the following versions for Git, tar, Python, gcc and make:
		- Git 1.8.3.1 or greater
		- tar 1.28 or greater
		- Python 3.8.0 or greater
		- gcc 8.0 or greater
		- GNU make 4.0 or greater


Build Host Packages
-------------------

Packages and package installation vary depending on your development system.

(*) Install the required packages for Yocto from https://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/system-requirements.html#required-packages-for-the-build-host


$ sudo apt install gawk wget git diffstat unzip texinfo gcc build-essential \ 
    chrpath socat cpio python3 python3-pip python3-pexpect xz-utils debianutils \ 
    iputils-ping python3-git python3-jinja2 libegl1-mesa libsdl1.2-dev pylint3 \ 
    xterm python3-subunit mesa-common-dev zstd liblz4-tool



Use Git to Clone Poky
---------------------

Once you complete the setup instructions for your machine, you need to get a copy of the Poky repository on your build host. 

Create a directory for your projects:

$ mkdir yocto; cd yocto/

Use the following command to clone the Poky repository:

$ git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky

Then move to the poky directory and take a look at existing branches:

$ cd poky
$ git branch -a

Choose a release codename (such as Kirkstone), corresponding to either the latest stable release or a Long Term Support release.

$ git checkout -t origin/kirkstone -b my-kirkstone

Note that you can regularly type the following command in the same directory to keep your local files in sync with the release branch:

$ git pull



Building Your Image
-------------------

The build process creates an entire Linux distribution, including the toolchain, from source.

Use the following steps to build your image:

1. Initialize the build environment: 

From within your project's directory (in this example, 'yocto'), run the 'oe-init-build-env' environment setup script to define the Yocto Project’s build environment on your build host.

$ source poky/oe-init-build-env

This creates and moves you to a 'build' subdirectory in your project's directory (~/yocto/build/).


2. Examine your local configuration file: 

When you set up the build environment, a local configuration file named 'local.conf' becomes available in a 'conf' subdirectory of the Build Directory. 

The defaults are set to build for a qemux86 target, which is suitable for emulation. 

The package manager used is set to the RPM package manager.

Uncomment and change the following lines:

	- DL_DIR ?= "${TOPDIR}/../downloads"
	- SSTATE_DIR ?= "${TOPDIR}/../sstate-cache"

You can also set BB_NUMBER_THREADS and PARALLEL_MAKE to twice your host processor's number of cores (add these lines to the end of the file):

	- BB_NUMBER_THREADS = "8"
	- PARALLEL_MAKE = "-j 8"


3. Start the build: 

Continue with the following command to build an OS image for the target, which is 'core-image-minimal' in this example:

$ bitbake core-image-minimal


4. Simulate your image using QEMU: 

Once this particular image is built, you can start QEMU, which is a Quick EMUlator that ships with the Yocto Project:

$ runqemu qemux86-64


5. Exit QEMU: 

Exit QEMU by either clicking on the shutdown icon or by typing Ctrl-C in the QEMU transcript window from which you evoked QEMU.



Challenge
---------

Run the image in QEMU with the 'nographic' option.

Generate an arm64 'core-image-sato' image and run it in QEMU (tip: build it with the -k option).

Add the "openssh" package to your build.
