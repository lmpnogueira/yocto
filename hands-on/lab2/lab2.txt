Lab 2
=====

This lab steps you through the process for a typical image build for the Raspberry Pi 4 using the Yocto Project. 

It allows you to explore layers. 

The Yocto Project’s “Layer Model” is a development model for embedded and IoT Linux creation that distinguishes the Yocto Project from other simple build systems.

Note: select the same branch supported by all layers that you use in this lab.



Raspberry Pi layer
------------------

Go to OpenEmbedded Layers (https://layers.openembedded.org/layerindex/branch/master/layers/) to search for layers "raspberrypi". 

In this example, we are going to use the branch kirkstone.

https://layers.openembedded.org/layerindex/branch/kirkstone/layer/meta-raspberrypi/

Read the overview to get some main points:

Repo: git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-raspberrypi
	- Branch: kirkstone
	- Readme: https://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-raspberrypi/tree/README.md?h=dunfell

Dependencies:
	- Repo: git://git.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded
	- Branch: kirkstone
	- Layers: meta-oe, meta-python, meta-multimedia, meta-networking



Get meta-raspberrypi
--------------------

$ git clone -b kirkstone \
    git://git.yoctoproject.org/meta-raspberrypi.git



Check the supported hardware
----------------------------

$ ls meta-raspberrypi/conf/machine/



Check the supported images
--------------------------

$ ls meta-raspberrypi/recipes-core/images

There are three images that you can build:
	- rpi-hwup-image.bb: image based on core-image-minimal
	- rpi-basic-image.bb: image based on 'rpi-hwup-image.bb', with some added features (ssh-server-dropbear and a splash screen)
	- rpi-test-image.bb: image based on 'rpi-basic-image.bb', which includes some packages present in "meta-raspberrypi" via a package group

Explore these files to have a grasp on the differences of these three images.



Get meta-openembedded
---------------------

$ git clone -b kirkstone \
    git://git.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded


Note: once you complete cloning, there should be three folders: poky, meta-openembedded, and meta-raspberrypi



Create the build folder
-----------------------

Run the environment script to setup the Yocto Environment and create build directory:

$ cd poky
$ source oe-init-build-env



Add the needed layers
---------------------

Add the meta-openembedded layers (meta-oe, meta-multimedia, meta-networking, and meta-python) and the meta-raspberrypi layer to 'conf/bblayers.conf'.

$ bitbake-layers add-layer ../../meta-openembedded/meta-oe
$ bitbake-layers add-layer ../../meta-openembedded/meta-python
$ bitbake-layers add-layer ../../meta-openembedded/meta-multimedia
$ bitbake-layers add-layer ../../meta-openembedded/meta-networking
$ bitbake-layers add-layer ../../meta-raspberrypi

Check the resulting layer configuration:

$ bitbake-layers show-layers



Set build configs
-----------------

Edit 'conf/local.conf':

	- Set the MACHINE to "raspberrypi4-64" (depending on which Raspberry Pi you want to use)

	- Uncomment and change the following lines:

		- DL_DIR ?= "${TOPDIR}/../downloads"
		- SSTATE_DIR ?= "${TOPDIR}/../sstate-cache"
	
	- Add the following lines at the end, to get a 'sdimg' image file to flash to a SD card:

		- IMAGE_FSTYPES = "ext4.xz rpi-sdimg"
		- SDIMG_ROOTFS_TYPE = "ext4.xz"

	- Add INHERIT +="rm_work" to save disk space on your build machine


Check the build configuration:

$ bitbake core-image-minimal -n



Build your image
----------------

Now you have minimal settings to build the first image:

$ bitbake -k core-image-minimal



Extra Raspberry Pi configurations
---------------------------------

To set specific hardware settings, you can have a look to 'extra-apps.md' and 'extra-build-config.md'. 

You find this files in the 'meta-raspberrypi/docs' directory.

The meta layer also provides a image configuration "rpi-test-image" to use with bitbake. 

The image is based on "core-image-base" which includes most of the packages in meta-raspberrypi and some media samples.

$ bitbake -k rpi-test-image



Extra software configurations
-----------------------------

Depending on what image build configuration you are using, you might need to install additional software packages.

You can do this, by adding some settings to the 'local.conf' file.

For example add the following lines, to set ssh-server, pi-user and systemd:

	# packages
	IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " openssh-sftp-server sudo python3 python3-pip rpi-gpio raspi-gpio"
	IMAGE_FEATURES:append = " ssh-server-openssh"

	# systemd settings
	DISTRO_FEATURES:append = " systemd"
	DISTRO_FEATURES_BACKFILL_CONSIDERED += "sysvinit"
	VIRTUAL-RUNTIME:init_manager = "systemd"
	VIRTUAL-RUNTIME:initscripts = "systemd-compat-units"

Note: The beginning space with :append is important, because the text is appended to existing configuration and needs to be separated with this space.



Flashing images on a SD card
----------------------------

The generated images are present in 'tmp/deploy/images/raspberrypi4-64' (or at the particular Raspberry version directory you selected)

Copy the 'sdimg' image file to a SD card:

$ sudo dd if=rpi-test-image-raspberrypi4-64.rpi-sdimg of=/dev/sdb bs=4096 && sync



Challenge
---------

Adds extra free space to the root filesystem image.

The variable IMAGE_ROOTFS_EXTRA_SPACE specifies the value in kilobytes and has a default value of 0.

You can check this with:

$ bitbake -e rpi-test-image | grep ^IMAGE_ROOTFS_EXTRA_SPACE
